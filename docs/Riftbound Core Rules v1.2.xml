<P>Must be a champion unit with a champion tag that matches the tag on your Champion Legend. Example: Loose Cannon has the tag Jinx. Therefore, a player could choose Jinx, Rebel or Jinx, Demolitionist as their Chosen Champion, because they also have the tag Jinx. Example: Tibbers has the tag Annie, but it is a signature unit, not a champion unit. It cannot be your Chosen Champion, even if your Champion Legend has the tag Annie. </P>

<P>A player’s Chosen Champion is both the specific card chosen for this slot during Deck Building and also any Champion Unit with the same name as the specific card selected for this specific slot during the course of play.  Example: A player chose Jinx, Rebel as their Chosen Champion. One copy of Jinx, Rebel starts the game in their Chosen Champion zone. Any additional copies of Jinx, Rebel in their Main Deck, their hand, their trash, or on the board also count as their Chosen Champion for any game rules and effects that care about Chosen Champion status during the game. </P>

As a Reaction, another player gives two of those Recruits +1 [M], so the Recruits’ Mights are 1, 1, 2, and 2. Then Fox-Fire resolves. The Recruits no longer have total Might 4 or less, so Fox-Fire’s controller must choose a legal subset of the original targets to affect. They could choose to kill the two 2 [M] Recruits, or the two 1 [M] Recruits plus one 2 [M] Recruit. The units they choose are Fox-Fire’s remaining legal targets.

</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>
<P>356.3.e.3. </P>
</TD>

<TD>
<P>If a target ceases to meet the targeting requirements while the spell is on the chain, then meets them again, it's a legal target.  </P>

<P>Example: A spell targets &quot;a unit at a battlefield.&quot; A player reacts with a spell that moves the unit to base, then another player reacts with a spell that moves it back to that battlefield, then the original spell resolves. The unit is a legal target. </P>
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>
<P>356.3.e.4. </P>
</TD>

<TD>
<P>If a target changes Zones to or from a Non-Board Zone and then returns to its original zone, it is no longer a legal target, because it's not treated as the same object.  </P>

<P>Examples:  </P>

<P>An enemy unit at a battlefield is no longer a legal target if it is no longer an enemy, no longer a unit, or no longer at a battlefield.  </P>

<P> </P>

<P>A unit with 3 or less Might is no longer a legal target if it is no longer a unit or if its Might is greater than 3.  </P>

<P> </P>

<P>Something that's exhausted is no longer a legal target if it is no longer exhausted. (It can't stop being &quot;something.&quot;)  </P>

<P> </P>

<P>A spell that's played from hidden can normally only target its own battlefield or something at that battlefield. A target for such a spell may cease to be a legal target if it moves from the battlefield where that spell was played, even if the spell has no location targeting requirement otherwise. </P>

<TR>
<TD>
<P>356.3.e.5. </P>
</TD>

<TD>
<P>If any of the spell's targets are no longer legal, those targets are unaffected by the spell as it resolves.  </P>

<P>Example: A player plays Void Seeker, a spell that says &quot;Deal 4 to a unit at a battlefield. Draw 1.&quot; The unit's controller uses a Reaction to move the unit to their base. Since the unit is no longer a legal target, it is not dealt any damage. Void Seeker's controller still draws 1. </P>

<TD>
<P>356.3.e.9. </P>
</TD>

<TD>
<P>The process for a card's choice becoming Invalid or Unavailable is referred to as mistargeting.  </P>

<P>Example: A spell has the instruction &quot;Deal 2 to a unit at a battlefield.&quot; Before that instruction can execute, the chosen unit is moved to its base. The instruction will not be executed, because it specifies that the unit it chooses must be at a Battlefield, and by the time it attempted to execute, the unit was no longer valid as a choice. </P>
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>
<P>356.3.e.10. </P>
</TD>

<TD>
<P>It is possible for none of a spell's instructions to be executed as it resolves, due to all of them requiring targets to act on and all of those targets becoming Invalid or Unavailable. In this case, the spell has no effect but is still considered played.  </P>

<P>Example: A player plays a spell that reads &quot;Deal 2 to a unit at a battlefield&quot; with no other instructions, and chooses an enemy unit at a battlefield. They also control a unit with the ability &quot;When you play a spell, give me +1 [M] this turn.&quot; Before the spell resolves, the chosen unit is moved to its base. The spell resolves and its only instruction cannot be executed, but the unit's ability still triggers as the spell resolves and gives it +1 [M]. </P>

<TD>
<P>356.3.e.11. </P>
</TD>

<TD>
<P>Instructions that can be partially followed are followed as much as possible and ignored otherwise.  </P>

<P>Example: A player plays a spell that says &quot;Discard 2, then draw 2&quot; If their hand is empty, the instruction to discard 2 will be ignored. They'll still draw 2. If they had 1 card in hand, they would discard it and draw 2. </P>

<P>If the spell checks information about a target that is no longer legal or a card or permanent whose location, zone, or status has changed such that that information is no longer available, that check returns &quot;null&quot; and all calculations based on it are ignored.  </P>

<P>Examples:  </P>

<P>A unit that is no longer on the board is treated as having null Might, null cost, etc.  </P>

<P> </P>

<P>A unit that is no longer on the board has no location, is neither exhausted nor readied, etc.  </P>

<P>Baited Hook says &quot;[1][C], [E]: Kill a friendly unit. Look at the top 5 cards of your Main Deck. You may banish a unit from among them that has Might up to 1 more than the killed unit and play it, ignoring its cost. Then recycle the rest.&quot; While Baited Hook’s ability is on the chain, an opponent reacts with a spell that returns the friendly unit to its owner's hand. Because the friendly unit is no longer a legal target, it can't be killed and its Might is treated as null. Baited Hook’s controller reveals the top 5 cards of their Main Deck, but can’t choose any unit from among them. </P>

<P>Triggered Abilities can usually be recognized by the word &quot;when&quot; followed by a game action or event; the word &quot;at&quot; followed by a point in time during the turn sequence; or the phrase “the [Nth] time” followed by a game action or event.  </P>

<P>&quot;When you conquer here, you may spend a buff to draw 1.&quot;  </P>

<P>376.1.b. </P>
</TD>

<TD>
<P>If an ability triggers “the [Nth] time” something happens and that trigger condition is met multiple times simultaneously, the ability’s controller picks one of those instances to serve as the trigger condition. The ability triggers only once, due to the chosen condition.  </P>

<P>Example: Wraith of Echoes reads “The first time another friendly unit dies each turn, draw 1.” That ability hasn’t triggered yet this turn. Two other friendly units die simultaneously (say, due to combat damage). The Wraith’s controller chooses one of those deaths to trigger Wraith’s ability. </P>

</TD>

<TD>
<P>If a Game Object with a Triggered Ability that is active in a specific zone, it is evaluated and subsequently triggered if it enters that zone at the same time that its Trigger’s condition is met.  </P>

<P>Example: Immortal Phoenix says “When you kill a unit with a spell, you may pay [1][C] to play me from your trash.” This ability triggers if Immortal Phoenix is in your trash immediately after you kill a unit with a spell, even if the unit you killed with a spell was that Immortal Phoenix. </P>
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>
<P>376.2.c.2. </P>
</TD>

<TD>
<P>A Game Object will not be able to successfully be able to evaluate its Trigger Condition, however, if it leaves the zone that its Trigger is active from at the same time that its Trigger is satisfied.  </P>

<P>Example: Viktor, Leader says “When another non-Recruit unit you control dies, play a 1 [M] Recruit unit token into your base.” This ability triggers if Viktor is on the board immediately after another non-Recruit unit you control dies. It does not trigger if Viktor and another non-Recruit unit you control die during the same game action (for instance, if they are both killed in the same Cleanup due to the damage dealt by Unchecked Power). </P>

The “do this” phrasing on Falling Star means that it has a reflexive triggered ability, which places two triggered abilities on the chain. As each of those triggered abilities resolve, it deals damage to the unit chosen for that ability. If one of these abilities deals lethal damage to a unit, both Falling Star and its ability are considered sources of the damage, and so both Falling Star and its ability are responsible for killing the unit. This means that Falling Star’s controller killed a unit with a spell, so Immortal Phoenix’s ability will trigger. </P>

</TD>

<TD>
<P>A player must obey all requirements and restrictions on damage assignment if able.  </P>

<P>Example: A player is assigning damage to the following units: a unit with Tank (&quot;I must be assigned combat damage first.&quot;); Caitlyn, Patrolling (&quot;I must be assigned combat damage last.&quot;); and another unit without any abilities.

<P>443.1.d.6. </P>
</TD>

<TD>
<P>If multiple Units have abilities or effects that require a player to assign them damage with the same priority, that player may assign damage to those units in any order.  </P>

<P>Example: A player is assigning damage to the following units: two units with Tank (&quot;I must be assigned combat damage first.&quot;) and one unit with no abilities.

<P>443.1.d.7. </P>
</TD>

<TD>
<P>If a Unit has one or more Abilities or effects applying to it that demand it be assigned damage in a specific way that is exclusionary, then the assigning player chooses only one of those abilities to apply when assigning damage. </P>

<P>Example: Caitlyn, Patrolling (&quot;I must be assigned combat damage last.&quot;) has been given the Tank ability (&quot;I must be assigned combat damage first.&quot;). A player is assigning damage to this Caitlyn with Tank and two units with no abilities. That player can’t fulfill both of Caitlyn’s damage requirements, so they may choose to assign damage to Caitlyn first, fulfilling the Tank requirement, or last, fulfilling Caitlyn’s printed requirement. They can’t choose to apply damage to Caitlyn in between the other two units, because that wouldn’t fulfill either requirement. </P>

<TR>
<TD>
<P>443.1.d.8. </P>
</TD>

<TD>
<P>If there is more than one unit in which this situation applies to, each unit is dealt with individually. The assigning player chooses which ability or effect applies, and then resolves the assignment. If this creates a situation where now more than one unit must be assigned with the same priority, those units may be assigned damage in any order as normal within that priority.   </P>

<P>Example: Two copies of Caitlyn, Patrolling (&quot;I must be assigned combat damage last.&quot;) have been given the Tank ability (&quot;I must be assigned combat damage first.&quot;). A player assigning damage to these two Caitlyns and one unit with no abilities could choose to fulfill both Caitlyns’ Tank requirements by assigning them both damage before the other unit. </P>

<TD>
<P>443.1.d.9. </P>
</TD>

<TD>
<P>If a unit cannot be dealt damage, then no amount of damage can be considered lethal. Such a unit is exempt from any considerations of mandatory assignment.   </P>

<P>Example: Fiora, Victorious has printed Might 4 and says “While I'm Mighty, I have Deflect, Ganking, and Shield.” If a player places a buff on Fiora, her Might is increased in the Arithmetic layer, after the layer for Ability-Altering Effects. The Ability-Altering Effect layer is then re-checked and the abilities Deflect, Ganking, and Shield applied. Since each effect has been applied once and there are no other effects to apply, Fiora’s characteristics are finalized as 5 Might with Deflect, Ganking, and Shield. While a buffed Fiora, Victorious is in combat as a defender, an additional +1 Might will be applied in the Arithmetic layer, giving her 6 Might and the 3 keywords.  </P>

<P>Example: A buffed Fiora, Victorious is in combat as a defender when her buff is removed. Reevaluating the layers in sequence, she no longer gains Deflect, Ganking, and Shield during the Ability-Altering Effect layer, so when the Arithmetic layer is evaluated, neither the buff (which is gone) nor Shield (which she no longer has) apply.

<P>Bonus Damage is an intrinsic property that can be granted to Deal actions that influence the amount of Damage that the action is distributing. </P>
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>
<P>714. </P>
</TD>

<TD>
<P>If more than one instance of Bonus Damage is applied or granted to a Deal action, all instances are summed and applied once. </P>
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>
<P>714.1. </P>
</TD>

<TD>
<P>Bonus Damage can only be a positive value, and can only increase the amount of Damage being distributed. </P>
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>
<P>714.2. </P>
</TD>

<TD>
<P>If, for any reason, Bonus Damage would be a negative number, then no Bonus Damage is applied to the action. </P>
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>
<P>715. </P>
</TD>

<TD>
<P>Bonus Damage applies to the total damage Dealt by one instance of the action. </P>
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>
<P>715.1. </P>

<P>If the Deal action has a single target, the amount of Damage to that target will be increased by the Bonus Damage granted to it. </P>
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>
<P>715.2. </P>
</TD>

<TD>
<P>If the Deal action has multiple targets, the amount of Damage dealt to each target is increased by Bonus Damage individually and separately.  </P>

<P>Example: Singularity is a spell that says “Deal 6 to each of up to two units.” A player plays Singularity while they also control Annie, Fiery, a unit that says “Your spells and abilities deal 1 Bonus Damage.” Singularity deals 1 Bonus Damage to both of its targets, dealing 7 to each. </P>
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>
<P>715.3. </P>
</TD>

<TD>
<P>If the Deal action Splits damage, then the Bonus Damage applies to the amount of Damage that will be Split. This can alter the number of targets eligible to be chosen.  </P>

<P>Example: Volibear, Furious is a unit that says in part “When I attack, deal 5 damage split among any number of enemy units here.” A player attacks with Volibear, Furious while they also control Annie, Fiery, a unit that says “Your spells and abilities deal 1 Bonus Damage.” Volibear, Furious now deals 6 damage split among any number of enemy units at its location, and can choose to split that damage among up to 6 units rather than the usual 5. </P>
